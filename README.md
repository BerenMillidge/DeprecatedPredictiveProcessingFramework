# DeprecatedPredictiveProcessingFramework
A predictive processing library/framework I was working on a while ago. It is deprecated now and not actively maintained. Hopefully in the future I'll replace with something better.

Nevertheless contains implementatiosn of many variants of predictive coding layers and algorithms including standard predictive coding of friston 2003/5, rao and ballard's 1999 architecture, and a numerous variants of layers inspired by Spratling and his divisive normalization and biased competition hypotheses.
